Basically to use testing you do go test 
// To go run a benchmark test first you make func BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B){

    for i := 0; i < b.N ; i++{
        code tuimhara which you wanna run
    }
} 



// for coverage to see
// you runn go test -cover ya -coverage 
// go test -coverprofile c.out
// the best way is go tool cover -html=c.out 
// website khol dega ye puri and you can see which part of the code is covered and not
